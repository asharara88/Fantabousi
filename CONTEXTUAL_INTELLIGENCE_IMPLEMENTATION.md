- **Enhanced Context Building**: Integrates user profile, health metrics, and conversation history
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Nutrition, fitness, sleep, supplements, stress management

### 2. Enhanced OpenAI Proxy (`/supabase/functions/contextual-openai-proxy/index.ts`)
- **Context-Aware System Prompts**: Dynamically built based on user data
- **Personalized Response Generation**: References specific user metrics and goals
- **Evidence-Based Guidance**: Includes confidence levels and scientific backing
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Supports voice and text interactions

### 3. Upgraded MyCoach Component (`/src/components/chat/MyCoach.tsx`)
- **Contextual Intelligence Integration**: Uses SessionManager and ContextualIntelligenceService
- **Health Domain Switching**: UI for switching between health focus areas
- **Session Management**: Persistent conversation state across sessions
- **Enhanced Voice Features**: Voice-to-voice mode with contextual responses

### 4. Database Schema Enhancement (`/20250120000000_contextual_intelligence.sql`)
- **Enhanced chat_sessions**: Session management with domain context
- **context_snapshots**: User context at different points in time
- **conversation_flows**: Multi-turn conversation management
- **intelligent_insights**: AI-generated health insights and patterns

## ðŸ§  Contextual Intelligence Features

### Session Management
- **Domain-Specific Sessions**: Separate contexts for nutrition, fitness, sleep, etc.
- **Context Snapshots**: Capture user state at key conversation points
- **Conversation Continuity**: Maintain context across multiple interactions
- **Session Expiration**: Automatic cleanup of old sessions

### Context-Aware AI Responses
```typescript
// Example of enhanced context integration
const contextualResponse = await contextualService.processConversation({
  sessionId,
  userMessage: "How should I adjust my supplements?",
  context: {
    currentSupplements: ["Vitamin D", "Omega-3"],
    recentHealthMetrics: { sleepHours: 6.2, stressLevel: 7 },
    healthGoals: ["improve energy", "better sleep"],
    domain: "supplements"
  }
});
```

### Multi-Domain Intelligence
- **Nutrition**: Meal planning, dietary recommendations, nutrient analysis
- **Fitness**: Workout planning, recovery optimization, progress tracking
- **Sleep**: Sleep hygiene, circadian rhythm optimization
- **Supplements**: Stack optimization, timing, interactions
- **Stress**: Management techniques, triggers, coping strategies

### Personalization Engine
- **User Profile Integration**: Age, gender, health goals, activity level
- **Health Metrics Analysis**: Recent biometric data trends
- **Conversation History**: Previous topics, preferences, progress
- **Evidence-Based Recommendations**: Scientific backing with confidence scores
